Provide beginner-friendly and intermediate-level examples

**What This Repository Includes**

Multiple Tkinter-based GUI applications

Reusable window and widget patterns

UI design best practices for desktop Python apps

Organized project folders for easy understanding

Documentation for each project explaining purpose and flow

**Highlights of Tkinter in These Projects**

Widgets: Labels, Buttons, Frames, Entries, Text, Canvas, Menus

Layout systems: Grid, Pack, Place
